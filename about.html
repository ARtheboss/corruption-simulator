		Since the purpose of this project was to show perspectives, I thought it would be interesting if people could experience my topic through the shoes of the people who control it/are affected by it. Through this project, I wanted to showcase how real of a problem corruption is, and that it is not to be taken lightly. In my research, I also discovered that many people do take corruption for granted, that it will always exist and will never be solved (<a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/magazine/americans-think-corruption-is-everywhere-is-that-why-we-vote-for-it.html'>1</a>). However, I created this to argue that it can be solved, and that <b style='font-style: italic;'>everyone in a country is responsible for stopping corruption. This is because the powerless are affected by it and the powerful should give them the means to take action.</b><br><br>

I provide two case studies in the game. One of Najib Razak and the Malaysian 1MDB scandal, and the other of Putin and Russia's tolerance. In the case of Najib Razak, a vigilant population put him in prison (<a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/how-malaysia-s-1mdb-scandal-shook-the-financial-world-quicktake'>2</a>). Putin's story is very different. He seems to have a lot of control over the population, and with censorship the Russian population is oblivious to corruption. And there sure is a lot of corruption: $40 billion according to recent estimates (<a href='https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/vladimir-putin-corruption-five-things-we-learned-about-the-russian-presidents-secret-wealth-a6834171.html'>3</a>). However, leaders with seemingly absolute power have been taken down before. William “Boss” Tweed, a mayor in 19th century New York, was very powerful in the state. He had a hand in everything, and used this influence to make some money for himself. However, it was the New York Times and a political cartoonist who took a stand against him, and in the end he was imprisoned with the help of the government s(<a href='https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/new-york/articles/william-boss-tweed-greed-corruption-and-the-expansion-of-new-york-city/'>4</a>). I feel something similar could happen with Putin, given enough time.<br><br>

This game is intended to be played by people who do not feel that corruption is a problem, in an effort to change their minds. After all, stopping corruption is a joint effort: It cannot be done unless the population is part of the solution.
